# Podman Darwin Compaction

Podman on macOS runs Linux containers inside a VM. With the `applehv` provider,
the VM disk is a raw sparse file on APFS. Guest `fstrim` can report large
trimmed byte counts inside the VM, but that does not prove the host raw image
released APFS allocation. The daemon therefore does not count `applehv` guest
`fstrim` output as host bytes freed.

## Review

Use dry-run JSON before enabling offline compaction:

```sh
tinyland-cleanup --once --dry-run --level critical --output json
```

The Podman plan reports:

- provider and running state;
- disk format and disk path;
- logical image size and physical host allocation;
- required temporary free space based on physical allocation plus headroom;
- active-container status;
- whether `qemu-img` is available;
- the exact stop, convert, verify, replace, and start sequence.

## Enable

Offline compaction is opt-in because it stops the Podman machine:

```yaml
podman:
  compact_disk_offline: true
  compact_min_reclaim_gb: 8
  compact_require_no_active_containers: true
  compact_keep_backup_until_restart: true
  compact_provider_allowlist:
    - applehv
    - libkrun
    - qemu
```

The preflight skips compaction when the disk path is outside expected Podman
machine directories, `qemu-img` is unavailable, active containers are running,
the provider is unknown, a rollback backup already exists, or the filesystem
does not have enough physical free space for the compacted copy.

## Rollback Boundary

When `compact_keep_backup_until_restart` is enabled, the daemon preserves the
original disk image as a `.backup` file until the compacted image starts
successfully. If restart fails, it restores the original disk and attempts to
start the machine again. Host bytes freed are reported from physical allocation
before and after compaction, not from the raw image's logical size.
