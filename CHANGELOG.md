All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository authority, contribution, security, and productionization docs.
- Bazel/Bzlmod surface for the Go build and test graph.
- GitHub CI and release workflow scaffolding.
- Shared-cache Bazel wrapper for GloriousFlywheel runner attachment.
- JSON cleanup cycle reports with dry-run plugin plans and host free-space
  accounting.
- Podman offline compaction preflight for Darwin VM disks, including physical
  allocation accounting and active-container safety gates.
- Podman BuildKit cache planning and critical cleanup with retention guards,
  command-byte reporting, and Darwin host free-space delta accounting after
  advisory VM trim.
- Structured dry-run targets for Darwin developer caches such as JetBrains,
  Playwright, Bazelisk, and pip.
- Nix cleanup preflight plans with dry-run reclaim estimates, generation
  retention targets, daemon-contention detection, and opt-in store optimization.
- Bazel cache and output-base dry-run planning with active-use detection,
  protected workspace symlink detection, and budget metadata.
- Top-level dry-run summary fields for planned estimated reclaim, required free
  space, and cleanup target count.
- Target-free report fields and real-cleanup stop behavior once the configured
  target is reached.
- Bazel real-cleanup deletion for stale inactive output bases, guarded by
  active-process inspection and permission normalization.
- Linux RPM packaging configuration, systemd unit, packaged config defaults,
  and release workflow RPM artifacts.
- Persistent daemon cleanup state with per-plugin cooldowns for non-critical
  daemon-triggered cleanup cycles.
- Structured dry-run targets for development artifacts such as stale
  `node_modules`, Python virtualenvs, Rust `target/` directories, Zig
  `.zig-cache` and `zig-out` directories, Go build cache, Haskell caches, and
  opt-in LM Studio model caches.
- Review-only large local artifact targets for disk images and VM bundles such
  as `.dmg`, `.img`, `.qcow2`, `.raw`, `.iso`, `.sparsebundle`, `.utm`, `.pvm`,
  and `.vmwarevm` paths.
- Opt-in Darwin developer-cache enforcement for typed JetBrains, Playwright,
  Bazelisk, and pip cache targets.
- Nix low-reclaim dry-runs now emit protected GC-root attribution targets so
  operators can see what is pinning the store before taking action.
- Human-readable `--output text` reports now explain dry-run and cleanup cycles
  with mount status, host free-space accounting, plugin plans, warnings, and
  representative targets.
- CLI `--target-used-percent` override for one-off cleanup runs without editing
  config.
- Bazel cache-tier budget enforcement for stale repository cache, disk cache,
  and Bazelisk download targets when total Bazel footprint exceeds the
  configured budget.
- Repo-local Bazel symlink cleanup after successful stale output-base deletion.
- Active-process protection for development artifact cleanup families such as
  Node.js, Python, Rust, Zig, Go, Haskell, and LM Studio.
- Typed Darwin developer-cache targets for VS Code and Cursor cache-only
  directories, with active-editor protection.
- CLI `--plugins` filter for bounded dry-run evidence collection and targeted
  cleanup cycles.
- CLI `--list-plugins` discovery output for plugin names, enabled state, and
  platform support.
- Dry-run cleanup targets now carry policy tier, logical byte, reclaim kind,
  and host-space reclaim expectation metadata where planner evidence is
  available.
- Review-only sparsebundle targets now report logical size from `Info.plist`
  when available, making APFS bundle physical-vs-logical accounting visible in
  dry-run plans.
- Darwin JetBrains cache planning now uses the configured `max_gb` budget to
  mark oldest inactive cache versions as opt-in aggressive cleanup candidates.
- Nix dry-run GC lock and SQLite contention now surfaces as
  `nix_daemon_contention` deferral when daemon-busy skipping is enabled.
- Nix generation deletion and GC commands now treat the same contention
  signatures as skipped cleanup rather than hard failures when daemon-busy
  skipping is enabled.
- Human-readable text reports now include target paths when a target has both a
  label and filesystem path, making review-only Nix GC roots and large artifact
  targets actionable without switching to JSON.
- Bazel cleanup now distinguishes active client output bases from idle
  server-only output bases, and aggressive/critical cleanup can stop stale idle
  servers before deleting their output bases when `allow_stop_idle_servers` is
  enabled.
- Dev-artifact cleanup now scans stale inactive temporary roots for narrower
  generated-output targets, allowing Rust `target/`, `node_modules`, Python
  virtualenv, and Zig output pruning without deleting the top-level temp root.
- Dev-artifact dry-run and cleanup filesystem walkers now observe cancellation,
  and active temporary roots are protected without expensive size walks so
  operator probes do not compete with active lab or Bazel scratch work.
- Darwin cache cleanup now treats the typed `darwin_dev_caches` plan as the
  real-cleanup authority when enabled, so `enforce: false` prevents legacy
  generic cache deletion paths from mutating developer machines.
- Nix real cleanup now dry-run preflights garbage collection and skips the
  actual GC command when there are zero reclaimable store paths and no user
  generation deletion happened, or fails closed when that preflight fails,
  avoiding pointless store-lock contention and unsafe fallback GC.
- Dev-artifacts dry-runs now surface large top-level temporary proof/output
  directories as protected review-only targets with active process path
  evidence.
- Dev-artifacts planning now has explicit scan budgets for duration, recursive
  entry count, and top-level temporary roots, with dry-run warnings and metadata
  when evidence is partial.

### Changed

- Go module path moved to `github.com/Jesssullivan/tinyland-cleanup`.
- Clarified that the legacy `target_free` config key represents the target
  maximum used-space percentage after cleanup.
- Critical Darwin cache cleanup now prefers typed developer-cache targets when
  `darwin_dev_caches.enabled` is true, avoiding broad `~/Library/Caches`
  sweeps unless the typed policy is disabled.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Darwin Podman fstrim accounting fix.
- Nix flake package for `tinyland-cleanup`.
